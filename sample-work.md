##Open Source Projects Authored:##

**Oracle PL/SQL Exception Handler:**

This project was an adaption from a conceptual example first presented through an _O'Reilly Guide_ on PL/SQL.  I made this one on a locally hosted instance (my laptop) of Oracle Express (XE), although I have developed working variations of this code on the Enterprise Edition platform.

**The UGLYSQL Project:**

Paired with my professional blog of the same name, I use this as an ongoing and growing repository of sample data schemas and interesting examples of SQL and PL/SQL concepts or code blocks that solve difficult or unusual (i.e., "ugly") query requirements.

##Side Projects:  Current Websites Maintained##

I maintain multiple online blogs and websites on different platforms.  I customize the look and design of each blog, write or curate content sourced ethically with proper attribution and from sources with clear licensing rights.


**The LOCALBIZGENIUS.COM**

My interest in online and offline marketing techniques targeting small and medium business development.  This blog is maintained using a new open-source platform known as [GHOST](http://ghost.org).  The original site template was an open source contribution and the images were photography samples sourced from my personal works or from _Creative Commons_ licensed photography posted on _Yahoo Flickr_.

**I Want More Coffee**

Another dot-com project I developed.  Made instead on the Google Blogger Platform, the design is from a Google stock template with Creative Commons sourced images.  The work is a mix of personal reflections on various topics (tagged:  coffee-chat) as well as edited and remixed content on the topics of coffee history, culture and folklore from around the world.  Some filtered work includes modified samples from purchased private-label (PLR) authored content.

##How I Help People With My Knowledge##

I am an active participant and editor of the knowledge-base, community resource _Stack Overflow_.  I concentrate on answering/solving problems submitted by other users in many areas of software development and programming.  A link to my profile is a great place to start, but if you want some examples from the 70+ solutions and user guides I have posted to date since the beginnning of this year.
