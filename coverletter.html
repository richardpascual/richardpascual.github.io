<p>Dear Ms. Charlene Moran:</p>


<p>I am a database developer and software professional.  I make stuff and solve problems and I <b>absolutely love it</b>.  Whether it's the collaborative delivery team, the end-user community or the endless selection of emerging and even older (perhaps forgotten?) technical options, my field is a rewarding arena to enter on behalf of any industry.</p><br>

</span></a>ABOUT MY CURRENT WORK EXPERIENCES</h2></div>


<div id="myindent"><p>For my recent experience with the project run by <i>Akimeka</i> (and later the <i>Data Networks Corporation</i>) I have been here in Maui, Hawaii.  I came out to the island for its great weather but also for the opportunity to make an impact on diversifying the industries of its local economy (Maui is a heavily tourist tourism-dependent economy.) The offices of Akimeka, LLC represents over a ten year legacy in driving the demand for a higher-ed trained workforce on the islands.</p>  

<p>Most of our own organization's workforce are mostly relocation efforts with recruits from the mainland, but the company involves itself by enhancing STEM education in elementary through college aged students.  One of the enjoyable experiences of my work here is mentoring college juniors and graduating seniors during the summer through the <i>Akamai Workforce Initiative</i> to work on projects with our database team.</p></div>

<a name="cal-berkeley-experience" class="anchor" href="#cal-berkeley-experience"><span class="octicon octicon-link">
</span></a>HIGHER-ED EXPERIENCE AT CAL BERKELEY</h2></hdr>


<div id="myindent"><p>Before my days at <i>Akimeka/DNC</i>, I worked in the higher-ed space (Development and Advancement).  I designed, developed and deployed database-centric solutions for the <b><i>University of California, Berkeley</i></b>.  Among my accomplishments, I transformed our technical department into a software solutions shop.  Our team eventually converted to using modern tools and relied on standardized developer processes (scm practices, code reviews, unit-testing and QA approval cycles).</p>  

<p>While at Cal we built and ran our data warehouse for campus-wide fund raising units (including self-service BI/Analytic tools), my favorite accomplishment was setting up multiple custom CRM, ETL and data transfer tools using a little known platform (at the time) known as Oracle Application Express (APEX).  Apex, for those who don't know is the precursor product to the also wildly popular Salesforce product.</p></div>

</span></a>MYSQL, OPEN SOURCE AND OTHER PURSUITS OUTSIDE WORK</h2></div>


<div id="myindent"><p>Most of the MySQL database experience I have is through my independent developer efforts through Open Source projects which I have used and tinkered with over the last decade and longer.  My latest technical passion has been learning how to leverage cost effective implementations of database + web-service platforms hosted by commercial data-centers that everyone these days wants to call "clouds".</p>  

<p>I was one of the early adopter developers who jumped in and started tinkering on Amazon's <b>U.S.-West-N.California</b> data-center making apps for use with a MySQL hosted database (since around 2007.)  In general, I have been watching and running my own open source projects on <b>Amazon's AWS</b> (These days, I'm specifically using products such as RDS (Running Oracle 11g-S1 and also MySQL), EC2, Route-53, S3, and others).</p>  

<p>I am also running smaller Linux server instances through other "cloud" hosting vendors to compare the relative cost to feature offerings.  I see that cost-efficient commercial offerings such as these may be a pivot point to opening accessibility to modern technology tools for non-profits, education, higher-ed and other "non-Fortune-500" organizations.</p></div>

</span></a>MYSQL, OPEN SOURCE AND OTHER PURSUITS OUTSIDE WORK</h2></div>


<div id="myindent"><p>With operations in Virginia/D.C., Texas and California as well there is a spectrum of challenges in dividing domains of responsibility will keeping some redundancy in our support functions.  I enjoy splitting time to tackle the effort of designing and proving solutions that have long-term and lasting benefit to the systems I support. Our most recent project as a multiple year-long effort to correlate existing performance and accuracy problems with solutions built into our customized data mart schema design and etl process.</p></div>

</span></a>A SHARED RESPONSE ON "NETWORKED IMPROVED COMMUNITIES"</h2></div>

<blockquote>Incidentally, the paper linked in the job post from <a href="http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/sites/default/files/bryk-gomez_building-nics-education.pdf">Carnegie Perspectives</a> referenced from the Carnegie team of Bryk, Gomez and Grunow raises a salient point on the concept of <b><i>Networked Improved Communities</i></b>.  With some close observation, these are the types of community units are a part of what is feeding the next renaissance in software and technology innovation.</blockquote>  
<br><br>
<blockquote>Developers and technology enthusiasts of varying skill levels now have access to tools and even open-licensed software to further their learning and their ability to work more effectively at solving problems in their own IT related work functions.</blockquote>
<br><br>
<div id="myindent"><p>It is fitting that the IT teams delivering the infrastructure and support to move ahead cooperative efforts (such as "NIC's" for education professionals) also are following similar patterns in knowledge sharing and collaboration.</p></div>

</span></a>RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT FUNCTIONS THROUGH COLLABORATION"</h2></div>


<div id="myindent"><p>The Akimeka/DNC office in Maui is designated the R&D division of our multi-geographical project team; our internal project Wiki has been our central gathering point of knowledge.  Ideas tried and succeeded/failed or new technologies discovered are evaluated and documented there.  When time permits, our database team meets for an informal seminar at lunch to share details about current project tasks in progress or just technologies that are of current interest to each of us.</p></div>
