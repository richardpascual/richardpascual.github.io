Dear Lawrence Livermore Hiring Staff,

I am an Oracle Database Developer by trade and my experience spans back to 1998.  I started developing applications using Application Express (APEX) since around 2006 (version 3.x) when I first started working at the University of California, Berkeley.  I have developed many applications for each organization I worked with ever since.

If LLNL wants to establish or expand an existing deployment of APEX, I might be useful to have on the team.  I am familiar with setting up the APEX architecture from scratch (under different constraints and available system resources), and I have also addressed various issues (such as security, maintaining database performance, user/developer training) from past APEX implementations.

I enjoy what I do, and I SHARE.  I am an active contributor to the Stack Overflow community.  I spend a few hours each evening crafting responses and developing tutorials in response to questions submitted from Oracle developers from all over the world, primarily on the topics of:   [oracle-apex], [plsql], [sql], [databases], [oracle], [oracle-xe], [oracle11g] and others.

The links to my past postings can provide a flavor of how I can explain concepts of these topics, whether it is for troubleshooting a specific problem, or figuring out how to expand the discussion into a broader subject so that more readers can benefit from the concepts involved.

I live on Maui where I am currently employed.  My employment is contingent on a government contract established for technology workers on the island.  We've run out of renewal rounds and I am planning in advance for a move back to my home ground, the San Francisco Bay Area.  There's time enough, but a swift relocation effort to get back to the Tri-Valley is possible.

I'd enjoy taking some time to talk with any of the staff members from your hiring team or even more so from the engineers/developers who have put out the request for this position.  Mahalo (many thanks)!

Regards,

Rich Pascual
